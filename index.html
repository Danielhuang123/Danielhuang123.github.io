        <p>About several days ago, I tried to put my weekly report on my blog, but I failed and even I didn’t know what’s wrong with it.So I had to ask teacher for help.However, it didn’t work as well, even worse, because I made a mistake and couldn’t log in the blog.Fortunately, I learned the rest of the Github course and finally manage it, so you may see the second blog is very late.Anyway, I also want to talk about my holiday life.Last time I said that I want to follow the timetable and regular my everyday life, but I failed.The reason is I have a lot of things to do everyday, so I even had forgotten about it.Maybe I only did several readings and listening for Ielts learning.However, I did do a lot of things besides the Ielts practice.For example, I attended a speech for the Big data investment.Athough I didn’t get it in the end of the speech, there’s still many useful information for me like the meaning of stock market and speculation and, even a good job orientation for me.Moreover, I found some references for my essay, although it has not started.I also start to keeping fit in a gym. I have course almost everyday and I keep practicing in the gym.I often feel exhausted after courses but I will keep on it. My aim is losing 5kg in the vacation. I think it is not very hard for me.</p>

        <p>Serveral days ago I finished the English training class and attended my first Ielts mock exam. I flatter myself that I got a good idea in the mock exam. My over-all score is 6.5 and to my surprise, I got an 8 for my reading part. Unfortunately, I only got a 5 for my writing because my composition was off the topic. I didn’t play my usual level in my writing maybe because I feel very nervous about this mock exam though I knew that it is only a mock exam. There is only one month left for my Ielts exam. This means I need to adapt the Ielts exam as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So I decide to make a timetable for me to prepare for my next month exam. At first I decide to make a timetable which have nothing but Ielts practice. However, after my today’s consulting class, I decide to add something in my timetable like Arduino and C++. I study C++ by myself because I think the process I explore the C++ is very fun so I consider that I don’t really need to attend a class for my programming. For Arduino, I want to seek some online courses to achieve the self-study. I also need to buy some small parts for my Arduino learning but that’s not matter. I have known something about Arduino because I had contacted with Arduino when I attended the OM competition. So I have this confidence to study it by myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have changed my opinion and decide to prepare the Ielts exam in a relative relaxed way. I will write more about my preparation for Ielts exam in later blog. I believe that I can get my ideal score for my Ielts exam!</p>

        <p>Hey! Welcome to my blog! From now on I will share my experience of my competition and study, or some feelings about my school life every week (perhaps). I believes that I my blog will be very fantastic because I put almost all the attention on creating the Github and learning how to write my blog. So I want to share something about my thoughts and some experiences of building Github in my first blog.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I didn’t take it seriously at first because I thought computer science and programming are my strong points, so I had confident to finish building in about 3 days. But I was wrong. The fact is, I spent more than a week and I even asked for extension of the deadline. Why I spent so much time on it, maybe one of the reasons is that, I use MAC OS instead of Windows which is the GUI of teacher’s. So I had to spent a lot of time to ask questions about my computer. Maybe I can create another problem sets which include all of my problems. Anyway, I think the most important reason of my extension is, I didn’t take it seriously at first. This made me start building the Github very late, about the third day. Now I think if I start it at first day and take it seriously, maybe I can finish it yesterday but not stay up to midnight to build my blog. But luckily, although it was not a good beginning for me, it was a good choice for me to use the Mac instead of Windows. Actually I do have a Windows laptop, but I use it only when I have to finish some assignment like programming with Visual basic because it is very old and heavy. I considered that if I use that laptop to build my blog, this means that I can not take my blog as one of my part of life. I saw a lot of people wrote their blog and, I think maybe this can become my lifestyle but not an assignment.</p>
<p>All above is my experiences of building Github, now I want to say something about myself. I want to introduce myself first. My name is HuangZiheng, this is my Chinese name. My English name is Daniel. Maybe you can call me Daniel Huang because this English name is very common. I like watching animation in my free time and playing piano when I feel upset. The favorite thing for me is staying at home and do something what I like. So I seldom go out at weekends except going for a walk or some competition. I mean…I seldom get together with my friends and play together in holidays. This doesn’t mean I’m very lonely, I have a lot of friends, I just want to enjoy my holiday without anyone else. But I try to change myself as well, I believe I can go out and enjoy my holiday one day instead staying at home by myself. Anyway, looking forward for my blog and my life! I swear that it will amaze you !</p>
